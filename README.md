# Etch-a-Sketch

This repository contains my version of the project 'Etch a Sketch' for the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch). This repository is my submission for this project. 

## What is Etch-a-Sketch
If you are living under a rock, etch-a-sketch is an old game that kids will spend hours on trying to create the most amazing art work on a pixeled art board using two dials. This time around, I created a version where when the user hovers over the board, the pixel that was hovered over gets colored in. 

In additional feature that was added was that the user can change the size of the board when ever they want at the top with a limit of 100x100 pixel board.
